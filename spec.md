# Brandon's LinkTree App Specification

## Overview
A simple, iOS-optimized Progressive Web App that displays a collection of Brandon's applications with their icons and names. When users tap on a row, they navigate to that app's page or URL.

## Implementation Status
✅ **COMPLETED** - Full implementation based on this specification

## Core Functionality

### Main Features
- Display a scrollable list of apps with icons and names
- Navigate to app URLs when rows are tapped
- iOS PWA optimized with bottom tab navigation
- Offline support with service worker caching

### App Data Structure
App data is dynamically loaded from PWA manifest files. The system fetches manifest.json files from configured URLs and extracts:
- `name`: Display name from manifest.name or manifest.short_name
- `icon`: Best available icon from manifest.icons array (largest size selected)
- `url`: Base URL derived from manifest location
- `description`: Description from manifest.description field

## User Interface

### Layout Structure
- **Left Tab**: Apps list (primary feature)
- **Right Tab**: About tab (app info, version, etc.)
- **Header**: App title and optional search functionality
- **Main Content**: Scrollable list of app entries

### App List Design
- Each row displays:
  - App icon (64x64px) on the left
  - App name as primary text
  - Optional description as secondary text
  - Chevron indicator for navigation
- Touch-friendly rows (minimum 56px height)
- Smooth tap feedback with visual highlighting
- Loading states for icons

### Visual Design
- iOS-native appearance with system fonts
- Clean, minimalist design
- Support for both light and dark modes
- Responsive grid layout on larger screens (iPad)
- Safe area support for iOS devices with notches

## Technical Implementation

### File Structure
```
/
├── index.html          # Main entry point
├── manifest.json       # PWA manifest
├── sw.js              # Service worker
├── icon.jpeg          # App icon (180x180px)
├── css/
│   └── styles.css     # Main stylesheet
├── js/
│   ├── app.js         # Main application logic
│   └── data.js        # App data configuration
└── icons/             # Local icons directory (deprecated)
    └── .gitkeep       # Icons now sourced from app manifests
```

### Data Configuration
Manifest URLs stored in `js/data.js`:
```javascript
const manifestUrls = [
    "https://brandondevmn.github.io/StoryStack-Web/manifest.json",
    "https://brandondevmn.github.io/EasyDice/manifest.json",
    "https://brandondevmn.github.io/QrGenerator/manifest.json",
    "https://brandondevmn.github.io/MysticalTeachings/manifest.json"
];
```

### Dynamic Manifest Loading
The app dynamically fetches each manifest.json file and extracts:
- App metadata (name, description, icons)
- Selects the best available icon (largest size)
- Handles relative and absolute icon URLs
- Gracefully handles failed manifest fetches

### Navigation Behavior
- Tap on app row opens external URL in same window (window.location.href)
- External links navigate away from link tree app
- Handle cross-origin navigation appropriately
- Loading indicators during navigation to external sites

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of failed manifest fetches
- Fallback SVG icon for missing or invalid icons
- Network error handling for external URLs and manifests
- Offline functionality with cached content
- User feedback for failed navigation attempts
- Continues loading other apps if individual manifests fail
