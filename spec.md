```

### Data Configuration
Apps data stored in `js/data.js`:
```javascript
const appsData = [
    {
        name: "StoryStack",
        icon: "./icons/storystack.jpg",
        url: "https://brandondevmn.github.io/StoryStack-Web",
        description: "Interactive story creation app"
    },
    {
        name: "EasyDice",
        icon: "./icons/easydice.jpg",
        url: "https://brandondevmn.github.io/EasyDice",
        description: "Simple dice rolling application"
    }
    // Additional external apps...
];
```

### Navigation Behavior
- Tap on app row opens external URL in same window (window.location.href)
- External links navigate away from link tree app
- Handle cross-origin navigation appropriately
- Loading indicators during navigation to external sites

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of missing icons (fallback icon)
- Network error handling for external URLs
- Offline functionality with cached content
- User feedback for failed navigation attempts
